							<p>Steps taken in Analysis:<br/> - The relevant data was extracted, transformed and loaded into Power BI using Power Query. <br/> - Measures were formed using DAX code. <br/> - Visual KPIs within the titles were created using conditional formatting. <br/>- Additionally, bookmarks were utilised to facilitate the analysis of Sales, Quantity, and Profit of each visual.
							<br/><br/>Overview:<br/>- This Dashboard was created to analyse the data set over three main n measures: Sales (Revenue), Quantity (Total Sold), and Profit (Revenue - Total Cost). This was done for each year (2015-2017).<br/> - KPIs are displayed at the top of the dashboard to clearly visualise the total values for each measure. With the percentage (%) change of each total from the Previous Year (PY) additionally highlighted above. A green circle indicates a "Positive" change and a red circle indicates a "Negative" change.
							<br/> - A somewhat static visusalisation (not affected by the change in measure only year) in the middle of the dashboard is utilised to provide insight regarding into Total Orders and Total Returns for each Product Type (for each year). With the same %PY and colour format as our KPIs above. Yet, an increase in Total Returns from PY is indicated with a red circle as this is a "Negative" change (increased returns is not positive).
							<br/> - Customer demographics are also visualised in this dashboard. Allowing us to form associations and explore variations across our three measures (Sales, Quantity, and Profit) by Customer Segment, Region, and State (for each year).
							<br/> - Furthermore, this dashboard details the Top 5 Products within each Product Category (again for each measure, for each year). <br/></p>
